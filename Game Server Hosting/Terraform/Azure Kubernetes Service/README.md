## Scenario Details

### Overview

This guide is designed to help you get started with deploying Game Server Hosts using the provided Terraform template(s) within this repository. Before you deploy, it is recommended to review the template(s) to understand the resources that will be deployed and how they are configured.

This accelerator is to be used as starter kit and you can expand its functionality by developing your own deployments. This scenario deploys a new Game Server Host workload, so it cannot be used to maintain, modify or add resources to an existing or already deployed Game Server Host workload from this accelerator.

### Game Server Hosts Architecture

This scenario deploys Game Server Hosts using Azure Kubernetes Service in a Spoke Virtual Network. This solution deploys a new:

- Spoke Network resources
  - Virtual Network
    - Subnet
    - Public IP Addresses

- Game Server Host resources
  - AKS Clusters
    - Default Node Pool
    - Node Pool

- Insights
  - Log Analytic Workspace
  - Log Analytic Solution

## Prerequisites

- Current version of the [Azure CLI](/<https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- Current version of the Terraform CLI
- An Azure Subscription(s) where you or an identity you manage has `Owner` [RBAC permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner)
- Ensure Encryption at Host feature is already enabled on the subscription. To enable: az feature register --name EncryptionAtHost  --namespace Microsoft.Compute. To validate: az feature show --name EncryptionAtHost --namespace Microsoft.Compute

### Naming

Resource naming is configured by pre set resource abbreviation and variables. Pick a unique resource prefix that is between 1-4 alphanumeric characters in length without white spaces.

### Assumptions

There will be an existing Hub Virtual Network with either a Gateway with access to on-prem and/or Bastion host deployed in accordance with [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/).

## Implementation

## Deployment Steps

1. Modify the `terraform.tfvars` file to define the desired names, location, networking, and other variables
2. Before deploying, confirm the correct subscription
3. Change directory to the Terraform folder
4. Run `terraform init` to initialize this directory
5. Run `terraform plan --var-file local.tfvars --plan.out ` to view the planned deployment
6. Run `terraform apply plan.out && terraform show` to confirm the deployment
